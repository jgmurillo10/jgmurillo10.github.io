The initial Proof Of Concept (POC) was sending dummy text messages using Twilio API but I extended to connect to an exchange rate API and send a text message daily with the USD to the COP exchange rate. Because of the scope of this POC, a text message channel was used instead of WhatsApp because of the approval required. So, this small project notifies daily the USD price in COP.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It was built on top of GCP architecture. There's a cloud function that queries an API to get the current exchange rate and sends a text message to my number with this rate. This cloud function is subscribed to a Pub/Sub topic that is triggered daily at 8 am by the Cloud Scheduler.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the end, I realized that people could be interested in subscribing to specific topics/data and get notified via text message or WhatsApp, not only exchange rates. We can think about a way to get custom information via messaging. In the future, maybe that's how newsletters could work. So, there are a lot of opportunities out there.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Here is the repository where you can check the code","spans":[{"start":0,"end":51,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://github.com/jgmurillo10/notifier","target":"_blank"}}]}]},"stack":[{"technology":{"text":"Cloud Scheduler"}},{"technology":{"text":"NodeJS"}},{"technology":{"text":"Cloud functions"}},{"technology":{"text":"Pub/Sub"}},{"technology":{"text":"Twilio"}}]}}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Juan Murillo","description":"Colombian Software Engineer passionate about web development and coffee.","author":"Juan Murillo | juanmurillo.co","image":"https://images.prismic.io/juanmurillo/5b80d6a0-22b2-425b-b33d-f6a77a88c5d3_arje_car_high.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"notifier","lang":"en-us","language":"en-us","intl":{"language":"en-us","languages":["en-us","es-co"],"messages":{"work":"Work","projectsCTA":"View private projects","subscribeDescription":"Subscribe here to keep up to date on this or other projects.","moreWork":"See other work","details":"Details","newsletter":"If you liked this post, type your email down below and click on 'Submit' to stay tuned.","readMore":"Read more","blog":"Blog"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/work/notifier","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en-us"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}

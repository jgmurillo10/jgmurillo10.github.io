The initial Proof Of Concept (POC) was sending dummy text messages using Twilio API but I extended to connect to an exchange rate API and send a text message daily with the USD to the COP exchange rate. Because of the scope of this POC, a text message channel was used instead of WhatsApp because of the approval required. So, this small project notifies daily the USD price in COP.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It was built on top of GCP architecture. There's a cloud function that queries an API to get the current exchange rate and sends a text message to my number with this rate. This cloud function is subscribed to a Pub/Sub topic that is triggered daily at 8 am by the Cloud Scheduler.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the end, I realized that people could be interested in subscribing to specific topics/data and get notified via text message or WhatsApp, not only exchange rates. We can think about a way to get custom information via messaging. In the future, maybe that's how newsletters could work. So, there are a lot of opportunities out there.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Here is the repository where you can check the code","spans":[{"start":0,"end":51,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://github.com/jgmurillo10/notifier","target":"_blank"}}]}],"stack":[{"technology":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cloud Scheduler","spans":[]}]},{"technology":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"NodeJS","spans":[]}]},{"technology":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cloud functions","spans":[]}]},{"technology":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Pub/Sub","spans":[]}]},{"technology":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Twilio","spans":[]}]}],"_meta":{"uid":"notifier"}}}]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Juan Murillo","description":"Colombian Software Engineer passionate about web development and coffee.","author":"Juan Murillo | juanmurillo.co","image":"https://images.prismic.io/juanmurillo/5b80d6a0-22b2-425b-b33d-f6a77a88c5d3_arje_car_high.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"notifier","rootQuery":"\n    query ProjectQuery($uid: String) {\n        prismic {\n            allProjects(uid: $uid) {\n                edges {\n                    node {\n                        project_title\n                        project_preview_description\n                        project_preview_thumbnail\n                        project_category\n                        project_post_date\n                        project_hero_image\n                        project_description\n                        stack {\n                            technology\n                        }\n                        _meta {\n                            uid\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n                description\n                author\n                image\n            }\n        }\n    }\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
